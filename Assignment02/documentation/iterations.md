# Prompt Engineering Iteration History

This document tracks the evolution of our game asset prompts through multiple iterations, documenting improvements, challenges, and learning outcomes.

## Iteration Framework

Each iteration follows this documentation structure:

1. **Iteration Goal**: Specific improvement target
2. **Prompt Modifications**: Changes made from previous version
3. **Results Analysis**: Outcomes and observations
4. **Learning Outcomes**: Key insights gained
5. **Next Steps**: Planned changes for future iterations

## Sample Iterations

### Iteration 1: Baseline Establishment

#### Goal
Establish baseline performance with standard prompting techniques for a 2D game character.

#### Prompt Used
```
Create a 2D character sprite for a fantasy RPG game. The character should be a wizard with blue robes, holding a staff, and have a long white beard. Make it in pixel art style.
```

#### Results Analysis
- Generated basic wizard character recognizable as the target
- Proportions were inconsistent with game art standards
- Color palette lacked cohesion with intended game style
- Limited detail in important character features

#### Learning Outcomes
- Basic descriptive prompts produce recognizable but generic results
- Need more specific art style reference points
- Technical specifications required for usable game assets
- Character proportion guidance needed

#### Next Steps
- Add specific pixel dimensions
- Reference existing art style examples
- Include silhouette guidance
- Specify viewing angle

### Iteration 2: Technical Specification Integration

#### Goal
Improve technical accuracy and usability of generated assets.

#### Prompt Modifications
```
Create a 2D character sprite for a fantasy RPG game in the style of Final Fantasy VI. The character should be:
- A wizard with medium blue robes with gold trim
- Holding a wooden staff with crystal top
- Have a white beard reaching mid-chest
- Front-facing perspective
- 32x32 pixel resolution
- Clear silhouette readable at small size
- Transparent background
- Limited to 16-color palette
```

#### Results Analysis
- Improved technical compliance with game specifications
- Better proportion consistency
- More appropriate level of detail for intended resolution
- Style closer to reference but still lacking distinctive elements

#### Learning Outcomes
- Technical specifications significantly improve usability
- Reference to existing game style provides better direction
- Pixel constraints help focus detail appropriately
- Still need better color palette management

#### Next Steps
- Add specific color hex codes
- Provide more detailed pose guidance
- Include negative prompts for unwanted elements

### Iteration 3: Visual Reference Integration

#### Goal
Achieve closer matching to reference game art style and improve artistic cohesion.

#### Prompt Modifications
```
Create a 2D character sprite for a fantasy RPG game in the exact pixel art style of Final Fantasy VI (SNES era). 

Technical Specifications:
- 32x32 pixel resolution
- Transparent background
- Limited palette using these exact colors: #3A66A7 (robe primary), #C9D9FB (robe highlights), #FCFCE0 (beard), #8F563B (staff)

Character Description:
- Elderly wizard with proportions matching FFVI character sprites (2.5 heads tall)
- Medium blue robes with light blue highlights on edges
- Standing in the FFVI standard front-facing idle pose
- White beard reaching mid-chest, clearly defined against the robe
- Holding a wooden staff with glowing crystal top slightly off-center

DO NOT include:
- Modern pixel art techniques like dithering
- Black outlines thicker than 1px
- Facial details beyond eyes and basic features
- Realistic proportions or shading
```

#### Results Analysis
- Significant improvement in style matching
- Color accuracy much closer to reference
- Proportions and silhouette appropriate for game context
- Technical specifications fully met

#### Learning Outcomes
- Explicit color codes produce much more accurate results
- Negative prompts effectively prevent common issues
- Reference to specific game titles helps the AI understand style
- Technical and artistic guidance must be balanced

#### Next Steps
- Create template structure for different asset types
- Test with different AI models
- Add animation frame guidance for sprite sets

## Advanced Iterations

### Iteration 4: Model-Specific Optimization

#### Goal
Optimize prompts for specific AI model characteristics to maximize quality.

#### Prompt Modifications
```
[Model-specific directives based on testing results]
```

### Iteration 5: Style Consistency Across Asset Sets

#### Goal
Ensure visual cohesion across multiple assets in the same game world.

#### Prompt Modifications
```
[Asset consistency directives]
```
